# GovSearch: Elasticsearch Government Official Directory

GovSearch is a sample project designed to demonstrate the power and efficiency of **Elasticsearch** for high-volume, real-time data indexing and retrieval. It implements a simple, yet robust, search engine over a large dataset of government officials.

### Features

- **Full-Text Search:** Supports advanced text search, allowing users to find officials by name, title, department, or location.
- **Faceted/Aggregated Search:** Demonstrates Elasticsearch aggregations (e.g., filtering by office type or state).
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Built to handle a large dataset efficiently, showcasing fast lookup times.
- **Simple Web Interface:** A basic front-end (e.g., using React, Vue, or a simple templating engine) to interact with the search API.
